# Guess the Number Game

## Overview
This is a simple and interactive number-guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The game provides feedback on each guess ("Too high", "Too low", or "Correct") and keeps track of the score and high score.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Logic for game functionality.

## How to Play
1. Enter a number between 1 and 20 in the input field.
2. Click the **Check** button to validate your guess.
   - If the guess is correct, the square displays the number, and a success message is shown.

## Code Highlights
### Random Number Generation
```javascript
let random_num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1;
```
This generates a random number between 1 and 20.

### Score Management
```javascript
if (score > 1) {
    message.textContent = guess < random_num ? "Too low!" : "Too high!";
    score--;
    scoreElem.textContent = score;
} else {
    message.textContent = "Game over! You lost. ðŸ˜”";
    scoreElem.textContent = 0;
}
```
Manages the user's score, displaying a "Game Over" message when the score reaches zero.

### Reset Functionality
```javascript
const againFunc = () => {
    score = 20;
    random_num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1;
    message.textContent = "Make a guess to see the result!";
    quest_square.textContent = "?";
    quest_square.style.backgroundColor = "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)";
    scoreElem.textContent = score;
    input.value = "";
};
```
Resets the game state for a fresh start.
